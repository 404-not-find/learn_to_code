This page doesn't try and list every single resource available, but instead links to resources that are guaranteed to be high-quality.\r\n\r\n### Where do I start?\r\n\r\nIf you know what you want to learn about, great! Jump to that section, start browsing the links, and find something which works for you.\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure where to start and which language to learn, some good beginner languages are:\r\n\r\n- [Python](#python) (general-purpose; scientific and mathematical computing)\r\n- [Java](#java) (general-purpose; Android development)\r\n- [HTML/CSS/JavaScript](#html-css-and-javascript) (websites and webapps)\r\n- [Scratch](#scratch) (for younger children)\r\n\r\nPython and Java are both languages that are [commonly used](http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/9-most-in-demand-programming-languages-of-2016/) to teach programming to beginners in schools and universities, and there are a wide variety of resources available to help you learn. They're also widely used in the industry which makes them useful languages to have in your toolbelt.\r\n\r\nWeb development has been very popular lately, so there are many resources for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, also making it suitable for learning. It requires little to no installation and configuration on your computer. All you need is a text editor to write code -- the code will run on your web browser.\r\n\r\n[Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y6J2jXjU34) is a little different from other languages. It was designed from the ground up to be easy to use and learn -- instead of typing text, you drag and connect together \"blocks\" to form programs, making it a very visual language. As a result, Scratch is a good language especially for younger children _(elementary schoolers, middle school)_ or for people who dislike typing.\r\n\r\n### How this page is organized...\r\n\r\nThis page is subdivided into three parts -- first, a _\"General resources\"_ section that links to sites that tend to deliver high-quality content about a variety of topics, and a _\"Specific resources\"_ section that provides resources on specific programming languages or topics.\r\n\r\nIn general, most resources available will fall between two categories -- online courses, and books + tutorials. Online courses tend to teach using video lectures, try and be more interactive, and try and emulate the structure of a course similar to ones you might take in college. In contrast, books and tutorials teach via written text and allow you to set your own pace.\r\n\r\n### Where should I start?\r\n\r\nWhether you prefer learning by watching a video or reading text is really a matter of personal preference. _I_ personally prefer visual, but your learning style might be completely different. You may need to explore and browse several different resources before you discover how you best learn.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you'll find that most links, whether they're online courses, tutorials, or books, tend to focus on either one of three things:\r\n\r\n  1. Some resources focus on _programming_, _semantics_, or _computer science theory_ -- in other words, how to use a programming language to write something that works.\r\n  2. Other resources will focus more on _coding_ and _syntax_ -- the particular details and rules about how a programming language works.\r\n  3. Other resources focus on teaching _idioms_ -- teaching best practices specific to that language, the underlying philosophy of that language, or teaching you about the different libraries available to you: the broader ecosystem.\r\n\r\nIf you're new to programming, the first model will be the best. Programming is all about applied problem solving: being able to take a problem, and break it up into smaller and smaller pieces until they're small enough to translate into computer code. Simply memorizing a collection of rules will not be very useful to you. You also need to learn how to _apply_ those rules.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you already know how to program, then you most likely already know how to do this. In that case, you're going to want to use the second kind since it'll be easier to learn about the differences between the language you're learning and ones you already know.\r\n\r\nOnce you've moved past the beginning phase, then it would be a good idea to try and move on to the third kind of resource, which will help teach you how to actually use and apply that language on a practical and professional level.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that a resource is _\"heavy in theory\"_ or _\"is rigorous\"_, I mean that it leans towards the first category. When I say that a resource _\"focuses on syntax\"_, I mean that it leans towards the second. And when I say a resource _\"focuses on idioms\"_ or _\"on practical applications\"_, I mean that it leans towards the third.\r\n\r\n### WARNING!\r\n\r\nThis page is still a **work-in-progress**! Some sections may currently be incomplete, and some links may not yet be fully vetted.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute, please see **[CONTRIBUTING.md][contrib]** for details.\r\n\r\n  [contrib]: https://github.com/ashleymcnamara/learn_to_code/blob/master/Contributing.md\r\n\r\n## General resources\r\n\r\n### Links to other big lists\r\n\r\nYou can find a huge and utterly massive compendium of [list of free programming books and resources on github](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md). (It used to be hosted on StackOverflow, but was moved over to Github on October 2013).\r\n\r\nYou can also find a meta _\"list of programming resources\"_ aggregator here: http://resrc.io/\r\n\r\n\r\n### Online courses\r\n\r\nOnline courses are an increasingly popular way for universities and professionals to teach programming and computer science in a structured format. As a result, new online courses will pop up all the time, so it's worth checking these resources periodically to see what's new.\r\n\r\n- **[Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)** - offers free online courses in several different languages. However, Codecademy does have a tendency to teach only basic syntax, so you may need work through more tutorials after finishing Codecademy. Focuses mainly on web development, Ruby, and Python.\r\n- **[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)** - offers free online courses in many different fields from several different well-known universities. New courses are added every quarter, and content from old courses is typically archived. Because many courses appear to be new/may be a one-time thing, this page will not link to courses on Coursera unless it appears to be stable.\r\n- **[Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/)** - offers free computer science courses taught by industry experts. Udacity offers two kinds of courses -- regular courses and nanodegrees. Regular courses are free. Regular courses with one-on-one tutoring/code review requires a monthly fee. Nanodegrees are typically for people with some prior coding experience, and cost more money.\r\n- **[edX](https://www.edx.org/)** - a joint effort between MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley to provide free online versions of some of their courses.\r\n- **[OpenCulture](http://www.openculture.com/computer_science_free_courses)** - similar to all of the above. Video lectures are typically available on iTunes or Youtube. Typically does **not** require you to complete assignments, unlike many other online courses.\r\n- **[MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)** - static course materials taught at MIT. Unless otherwise noted, most content from this website tends to be very rigorous and fast-paced.\r\n- **[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)** - contains a few courses on programming and computer science; does contain many more courses on all kinds of topics (especially math).\r\n- **[Stanford Engineering Everywhere](http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx)** - static course materials taught at Stanford.\r\n\r\nThe following websites also contain a wide variety of tutorials for many different topics, but require payment and registration before you can access their courses.\r\n\r\n- **[Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/)** - focuses on web and iOS development.\r\n- **[Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/)** - also includes courses on design, animation, video, business, and more.\r\n- **[PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/)** - similar to Lynda, but with a focus on developer and IT courses.\r\n-  **[General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)** - also includes courses on design, animation, video, business, and more.\r\n\r\nIn general, edX, OpenCulture, MIT OpenCourseware, and Stanford Engineering Everywhere tend to contain more rigorous, thorough, and demanding courses, whereas Codecademy and Khan Academy tend to focus on giving a more gentle introduction to programming. Coursera and Udacity tend to vary between these two extremes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Programming Languages\r\n\r\n### C\r\n\r\nNote: C can be a difficult-to-teach language. Although the online courses and books are a good starting point and can take you a long way, the general consensus is that the best way to learn is through reading an actual book.\r\n\r\n- **Online courses:**\r\n    - MIT Open Courseware has a few:\r\n        - [Practical Programming in C][c-mit-practical]\r\n          For beginners.\r\n        - [Introduction to C Memory Management and C++ Object-Oriented Programming][c-mit-intro]\r\n          Geared towards people with prior experience in a programming language that is not C or C++.\r\n        - [Effective Programming in C and C++][c-mit-effective]\r\n          Similar to the above.\r\n- **Video tutorials:** N/A\r\n- **Interactive tutorials:**\r\n    - [Learn-C][c-learn-c]\r\n      An interactive online guide that teaches you basic C step-by-step.\r\n- **Books and tutorials (online):**\r\n   -  [Learn C The Hard Way][c-lcthw]\r\n      Part of the \"Learn X the Hard Way\" series.

The language is named for [Haskell Brooks Curry](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_Brooks_Curry), whose work in mathematical logic serves as a foundation for functional languages. Haskell is based on the [lambda calculus](https://wiki.haskell.org/Lambda_calculus), hence the lambda they use as a logo.\r\n- **Online courses:**\r\n    - edX's [Introduction to Functional Programming][haskell-intro-func]\r\n      Assumes familiarity with a non-functional programming language (Java, Python, C#, C++, etc).\r\n- **Interactive tutorials:**\r\n    - [Try Haskell][haskell-try]\r\n      An interactive guide that teaches basic Haskell.\r\n- **Video tutorials:** N/A\r\n- **Books and tutorials (online):**\r\n    - [Getting started with Haskell][haskell-getting-started]\r\n      A comprehensive meta-guide that suggests the recommended order for following Haskell tutorials from beginning to advanced.\r\n    - [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good][haskell-great-good]\r\n      A beginner's introduction to Haskell.

CSS is used to describe the _style_ and _appearance_. JavaScript is used to add _behavior_ and _interactivity_.\r\n\r\nThe recommended learning order is typically to start with HTML and CSS, then move on to learning JavaScript once you feel you've acquired a basic understanding of the previous two.\r\n\r\nAlso note that HTML and CSS are examples of \"markup languages\", not \"programming languages\" and so will feel fairly different from JavaScript. If your goal is to learn just programming, you might want to jump straight ahead to JavaScript (or pick a different programming language!). However, since the main way to actually use JavaScript is through the web browser, you _do_ need to learn HTML and CSS at one point or another.\r\n\r\n- **Online courses:**\r\n    - Dash teaches HTML, CSS, and Javascript through fun projects you can do in your browser.\r\n      - [Make a website][general-assembly-make-website]\r\n    - Codecademy has several courses related to web development.\r\n        - [Make a website][webdev-cc-make-website]\r\n        - [Make an interactive website][webdev-cc-make-interactive]\r\n        - [HTML & CSS][webdev-cc-html-css]\r\n        - [JavaScript][webdev-cc-js]\r\n        - [jQuery][webdev-cc-jquery]\r\n    - So does Udacity:\r\n        - [Intro to HTML and CSS][webdev-uda-html-css]\r\n        - [JavaScript Basics][webdev-uda-js]\r\n          Does require some prior programming experience.\r\n    - Open Culture's [Building Dynamic Websites][webdev-open-dynamic]\r\n      Hosted by Harvard, and covers a wide variety of topics.\r\n    - Khan Academy has a series of [three courses][webdev-khan] on introductory Javascript that focuses on drawing graphics and animations, and making games.\r\n    - Team Treehouse has a series of courses on [HTML][webdev-treehouse-js], [CSS][webdev-treehouse-css], and [Javascript][webdev-treehouse-js]\r\n      Allows a free 14-day trial, but later requires payment.\r\n- **Interactive tutorials:**\r\n    - [CSS3, please!][webdev-please]\r\n      An interactive website that lets you dynamically change CSS rules to style an element on-screen.

(and fast automated fixes) Perl can, and does, cover for that.\r\n\r\nThe extensive CPAN collection is very handy, when dealing with prototypes.\r\n(Batteries may not be included, but they're still right there, on the shelf)\r\n\r\n**Remember drawbacks, though:**\r\n\r\n- Object support in Perl sucks hard, you bless references and do unholy stuff in the name of objects, then wonder why you took all the trouble in the first place.\r\n- Reading other people's Perl is more than a craft, it's science, and a painful one, too.\r\n- Perl is nifty, it makes you think nifty, it makes you feel nifty, you become a programming rockstar. Now, think about getting up, and going to work in a office full of rockstars: it's a \"boat that rocks\" hard.

(See [PHP: a fractal of bad design][php-fractal]). If you do decide to learn PHP and adopt it as your language of choice, just be aware of the fact that people will probably make fun of you at one point or another.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's important to first learn [HTML and CSS](#html-css-and-javascript) before attempting to learn PHP. PHP is a language which attempts to \"extend\" and work with HTML, so may not fully make sense if you try and learn it before picking up basic web development.\r\n\r\n- **Online courses:**\r\n    - Codecademy's [PHP track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/php)\r\n    - Team Treehouse's [PHP course](http://teamtreehouse.com/features/php) - allows a free 14-day trial, but later requires payment.\r\n- **Interactive resources:**\r\n    - [Learn PHP][php-learn]\r\n      An interactive guide that teaches basic PHP.\r\n- **Exercises:**\r\n- **Video tutorials:** N/A\r\n- **Books and tutorials (online):**\r\n    - [PHP Manual][php-manual]\r\n      The official tutorial on PHP.

Python 3 is the most recent version, but for a variety of reasons Python 2 still is fairly popular among many developers.\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure which version to pick, my recommendation would be to pick the resource which looks like the best fit for you, and just use whatever version they're recommending. Luckily, the differences between the two are very minor (at least from the perspective of the beginner), so there's really no difference if you learn using Python 2 vs Python 3.\r\n\r\n- **Online courses:**\r\n    - edx's [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python][python-mit-intro]\r\n      The companion book can be [found here][python-mit-intro-book].

While it does briefly cover Python syntax,\r\n      it assumes that you already have some basic prior experience.\r\n    - [Dive into Python 3][python-dive]\r\n      An accelerated introduction to Python. Warning: do NOT use \"Dive into Python 2\".

Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the resources available [at golang.org](http://golang.org/doc/#learning) there are a range of community-driven initiatives:\r\n\r\n- **Books (online):**\r\n  - [The Little Go Book](http://openmymind.net/The-Little-Go-Book/) The Little Go Book is a free introduction to Google's Go programming language. It's aimed at developers who might not be quite comfortable with the idea of pointers and static typing. It's longer than the other Little books, but hopefully still captures that little feeling.\r\n- **Books (paper):**\r\n  - [Go in Action](http://www.amazon.com/Go-Action-William-Kennedy/dp/1617291781/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1460415974&sr=8-2&keywords=golang): Go in Action introduces the Go language, guiding you from inquisitive developer to Go guru. The book begins by introducing the unique features and concepts of Go. Then, you'll get hands-on experience writing real-world applications including websites and network servers, as well as techniques to manipulate and convert data at speeds that will make your friends jealous.\r\n  - [The Way to Go: A Thorough Introduction to the Go Programming Language](http://www.amazon.com/Way-Go-Thorough-Introduction-Programming-ebook/dp/B0083RVAJW/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1460415974&sr=8-9&keywords=golang): Pros - Book is very relevant and up-to-date, well-structured (maybe too well-structured at times), covers virtually everything in Go language, has a myriad of useful code examples. Cons - Author is not a native speaker and it shows. At times it is a bit hard to understand his writing - proofreading was definitely needed.\r\n  - [Introducing Go: Build Reliable, Scalable Programs](http://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Go-Reliable-Scalable-Programs/dp/1491941952/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1460415974&sr=8-6&keywords=golang): Perfect for beginners familiar with programming basics, this hands-on guide provides an easy introduction to Go, the general-purpose programming language from Google. Author Caleb Doxsey covers the language’s core features with step-by-step instructions and exercises in each chapter to help you practice what you learn.\r\n  - [The Go Programming Language](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1460415974&sr=8-1&keywords=golang): The Go Programming Language is the authoritative resource for any programmer who wants to learn Go. It shows how to write clear and idiomatic Go to solve real-world problems.
